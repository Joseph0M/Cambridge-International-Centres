# Find a Cambridge International Exam Centre near you!


For students that are sitting CIE qualifications, it may be challenging to find an exam centre that would accept private candidates (as their website is not optimal).
Use `premade_map.html` to view the centres in the UK, or use the source code to change and alter the parameters.


This algorithm uses the Google Maps API. By using this, you accept the terms and conditions of Google Cloud and Cambridge International.


For changing the parameters, you will need an API key that allows all traffic and has the Place API enabled.
By default, the algorithm searches all towns and cities recognised by CIE and returns positive hits from their website.
